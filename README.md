# SNESControllerOrAI
Team 18 Senior Design Project

 This is the respository for the software part of Team 18's Project
 
   Team Leader: Mickael Rumpoff
  
   Software Lead: Jacob Widman
  
   Hardware Lead: Kyle Landry
  
   R&D Lead: Andrew Frosch
   
   Project Plan: Make a controller that is able to manually play SNES games or delegate playing the game to an AI.
   
   General thoughts: 
      Program an AI that can track motion through parabolic equations once XY coordinates are aquired.
      Have 3 models of different games: Shooter, Platform, Other
     
   Algorithom used: Imitation learning
  
   Status: Have variables for one game, working on another. 
   Imitation learning may need to be work with one game, then train with another.
